## Foresight

This portfolio was designed to show some of the work and features that I can implement. I will continue to upload projects that display my work.

---

## Incentive

The motivation behind this portfolio is to display work/ features while they are fresh.

---

## Challenges

Building a responsive layout using a frameworks' grid system (Bootstrap in this case) can be challenging. The main challenge can be trying to get the browser to display content exactly where you want it to show. Going through the documentation helps and great deal.

---

## Reasoning

This project was built as a means to show competence in responsive layout design and mobile-first application development.

---

## Solution

If websites are not up to date with responsive web design, a second website may be needed in order to have to content render on different devices properly. Having a responsive mobile-first application will help to save on extra costs when it comes to development with just this alone. Responsive web applications help end users to use the web page more effectively with their desired screen size and device.

---

## Take away

Mobile-first, responsive web design is important. There is nothing more unattractive to an end user than to see a poorly displayed web page that has their interest. Along side of having an eye sore, poorly built websites that do not render properly on different devices can bring about suspicion of brand authenticity and push a potential client or reader of your content away.
