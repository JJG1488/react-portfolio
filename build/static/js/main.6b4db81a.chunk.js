I love being creative and being able to express my creativity even more. I am infatuated with the \"click\" moments that you get when things begin to sink in and make sense. So naturally, I picked up every book that I could about coding and began to read them. There was this idea that I could build my own applications and submit them to the world to see that became a source for my drive to learn more about coding.
