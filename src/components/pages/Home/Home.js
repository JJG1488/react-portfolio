          <span>
            <span style={{ marginRight: "5%" }} />I wear many hats in my everyday life. Whether its engineering a company's network, doing electrical
            work for security systems, working wood
            in my garage, learning and applying web development skills, or just being the
            loving and caring father that I am everyday, I love what I do and I do it all with passion and
            purpose. I had an ios application out in 2018, but
            I didn't feel good about the project because I did not build the project myself and was not entirely
            in control of the creative process. I love being creative and being able to express my creativity
            even more. I am infatuated with the "click" moments that you get when things begin to
            sink in and make sense. So naturally, I picked up every book that I could about coding and began to
            read.
            There was this idea that I could build my own applications and submit them for the world to see that
            became
            a source for my drive to learn more about coding. Then I realized that this is a skill that can be
            passed along, and
            from that, purpose was added to my drive to learn.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            <span style={{ marginRight: "5%" }} />Development in general is more than a hobby or skill to me. It is a tool that can be used to change
            the lives of any and everyone. I equate developing to having a super power. To be able to work with
            people or companies to help them make their dreams or products come to life is a big deal to me.
            Just as
            someone took the time out to help me bring my application to life, which was my dream at that
            moment, I
            want to do the same and help people to build and create tools and applications that can fulfill
            their
            dreams and help make the world a better place. I'm excited to hear about new ideas and helping to
            come
            up with ways to bring them to life.
